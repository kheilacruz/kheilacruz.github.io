            <h2>What is Atom?</h2>
            <p>
                Atom is a text editor that's modern, approachable, yet hackable - a tool you can customize to do anything but also use productively.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is great about this application is that Atom helps you write code faster with a smart, flexible autocomplete. Atom also works across operating systems. You can use it on OS X, Windows, or Linux. You can also split your Atom interface into multiple
                panes to compare and edit code across files.
            </p>
            <h2>What is Github?</h2>
            <p>
                GitHub is an open-sourced version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds — the creator of Linux. Essentially, when developers are creating something, they are making constant changes to the code and releasing new versions. So, with that being
                said, GitHub keeps these revisions and store the modifications in a central repository (explained in next paragraph). This allows developers to collaborate, make changes and upload the newest revision efficiently. Also, for those who have
                nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use them.
            </p>


            <h2>Process of Using Atom</h2>
            <p>To get things started, you must download Atom. Once you've gotten the application downloaded, go to GitHub.com and create an account. In the GitHub home, you must then create a repository. A repository, or “repo” for short, is a digital directory
                or storage space where you can access your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. To set up a new repository, you click New on the right hand side and save the repository as username+github.io. We then go
                to desktop.github.io and download GitHub Desktop to sync all projects and files from Atom onto GitHub. Once this final application is downloaded, we must then click the "+" button on the top left of the page to clone the repository we
                previously created. This will help us sync any changes made from Atom onto GitHub. When this step is completed, we may now open our file onto Atom. In order to do this, we click Add Project Folder and select the file. Any changes made
                on the index or css files will show on the GitHub Desktop application and can be saved onto your GitHub repository by clicking on the “Commit to master” button. </p>
