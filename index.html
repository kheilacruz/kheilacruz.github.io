            <h2>Process of Using Atom</h2>
            <p>To get things started, you must download Atom. Once you've gotten the application downloaded,
               go to GitHub.com and create an account. In the GitHub home, you must then create a repository.
                A repository, or “repo” for short, is a digital directory or storage space where you can access
                 your project, its files, and all the versions of its files that Git saves. To set up a new
                 repository, you click New on the right hand side and save the repository as username+github.io.
                  We then go to desktop.github.io and download GitHub Desktop to sync all projects and files
                  from Atom onto GitHub. Once this final application is downloaded, we must then click the "+"
                  button on the top left of the page to clone the repository we previously created. This will
                  help us sync any changes made from Atom onto GitHub. When this step is completed, we may now
                   open our file onto Atom. In order to do this, we click Add Project Folder and select the file.
                    Any changes made on the index or css files will show on the GitHub Desktop application and
                    can be saved onto your GitHub repository by clicking on the “Commit to master” button. </p>
